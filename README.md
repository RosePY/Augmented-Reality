### Abstract from report
Augmented Reality (AR) applications are gradually becoming part of our lives allowing us to interact with virtual computer-generated information on a real world environment. Some applications in our smartphones as Pokemon Go are having a great success due to the incorporation of this novel technology. In the present work, we use augmented reality to project an image over a rectangular surface following the same transformation as it moves throughout the frames of a video. In order to accomplish this task, we use ORB (Oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF) as a feature detector. Next, we determine the matches between the feature descriptors of the  target frame and each frame in the video. Subsequently, we determine an affine transformation among the object points in both images using RANSAC. Afterward, we transform our  overlying image using the aforementioned affine transformation and paste it over each frame in the video. At last, a video comprised of all the processed frames is created.
